# ManaTTS Forced Aligner: Robust Forced Alignment for Low-Resource Languages

**Want to create a speech dataset, but current forced alignment tools don‚Äôt work for your setup?**

**ManaTTS Forced Aligner** is a robust, language-agnostic forced alignment module designed specifically for **low-resource languages** and imperfect audio-text matches. Unlike traditional tools like Aeneas, our method **does not require a perfect match between audio and text**. It tolerates skipped words, repetitions, or inconsistencies, using **multiple ASR models** and **character-level text similarity** with predefined thresholds.

## Why Use ManaTTS Forced Aligner?

üß† **ASR-Agnostic and Scalable**: Use *one or more automatic speech recognition (ASR) models*, regardless of their quality.
The aligner is designed to work even with imperfect ASRs. However, **the more ASR models you provide, the more robust and accurate the alignment becomes**, thanks to majority-voting and fallback mechanisms.

üß© **Mismatch-Tolerant**: Handles skipped or added phrases, word reorderings, and slight transcription errors.

üß™ **Flexible Scoring**: Matches based on character error rate (CER), with configurable thresholds.

üîì **Open and Extendable**: Built in Python, licensed under MIT, and ready to adapt to your language and ASR tools.

üåç **Proven in Practice**: Successfully used to generate **102+ hours** of aligned speech-text data for the Persian ManaTTS corpus.

## How It Works

The alignment process consists of two key components:

### 1. Transcription Module

* Runs multiple ASR models on each audio chunk
* Discards unreliable transcripts (e.g., truncated outputs)
* Sorts by reliability and returns top transcripts

### 2. Forced Alignment

* Splits audio into 2‚Äì12 second segments based on silence
* Uses the transcription module to hypothesize possible texts
* Finds best-matching substrings in the reference text
* Accepts matches based on CER:

  * **High quality**: CER ‚â§ 0.05
  * **Middle quality**: 0.05 < CER ‚â§ 0.2
* Chunks with no acceptable match are discarded

The algorithm uses **Interval Search** first, then **Gapped Search** only if needed.

## Getting Started

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UPn4rdJhBevur9R7Rm6tUz3KrQSKFaoe?usp=sharing) 

You can use the forced alignment method via [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UPn4rdJhBevur9R7Rm6tUz3KrQSKFaoe?usp=sharing) or [the forced alignment notebook](ManaTTS-Forced-Aligner.ipynb) in this repository.

üí° To adapt it for your language, simply embed **one or more ASR models** (the more the better!) that work for your language into the transcription module section of the notebook.
